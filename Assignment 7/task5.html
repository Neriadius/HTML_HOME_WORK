            <div class="flip" id="flip2">A long time ago… </div>
            <div class="panel" id="panel2">Believe it or not, Halloween's birthplace is not a sugar factory: the holiday has been around for about 6,000 years, and it is believed to have originated about 4,000 years ago BC in Ireland.</div>

            <div class="flip" id="flip3">Death or life</div>
            <div class="panel" id="panel3">Halloween originates from the ancient Celtic Samhain festival, a celebration of the end of the harvest season. At that time, the Gali believed that on October 31, the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead were erased, and those who had passed away could return to life and harm the living. Do you know one way to scare the dead? Wear costumes and masks.</div>

            <div class="flip" id="flip4">The ship of sweets</div>
            <div class="panel" id="panel4">Of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent annually in America alone, 2.08 billion US dollars are spent on Halloween candies. How many sweet treats can you buy with this money? Approximately 600 million pounds – which can be used to buy 6 Titanic ships.</div>

            <div class="flip" id="flip5">Boo!</div>
            <div class="panel" id="panel5">Are you afraid of Halloween? Then maybe you suffer from samhainophobia - that's what the fear of Halloween is called.</div>
