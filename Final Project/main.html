                I decided to dedicate my final project to my friend's self-written desktop role-playing system. This system is very simple and very flexible. In it, you can create a character any way you want, what he will look like and what he will fight with. In this system, unlike the others, you can come up with a spell yourself and how it will work and how much damage it will cause, it's up to you to decide.

                my friend created this system inspired by comics and their freedom of action. That's why this system is so flexible. This is the philosophy of the system

                Using this website, you will already be able to create your character, his spells and race.  To create a character, go to the "create character" tab; to create a spell, go to "spells"; and for a race, go to "species". The project also contains the rules of the system, where you can read them in the "rules" tab
